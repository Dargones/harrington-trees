## Installation

`yarn install`

## Running the development server

`yarn start`

## Building for deployment

Before creating a production build you need to know the path where it will be accessed.
Then run the command `PUBLIC_URL='./path/of/app' yarn build`.
This will generate a set of static files in the `build/` directory that you can serve.

For example, if you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/` then run `PUBLIC_URL='./' yarn build`.
If you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/lexica/lsj` then run
`PUBLIC_URL='./lexica/lsj' yarn build`.

## Deploying a new version to github.io

`yarn deploy`

### Updating template

* `git pull source master`
* Fix merge conflicts
* `git push origin master`
